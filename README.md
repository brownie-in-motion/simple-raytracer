# Simple Raytracer

![colored balls on checkered ground](/images/basic.png)

This is a simple path tracer based on Wikipedia and high-school level physics
headcannon. It is written in C++, but none of the code is very idiomatic.
There is a basic notion of textures, but refraction is not implemented
successfully. Future work, perhaps.
